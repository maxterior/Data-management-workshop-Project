# How many plots does each species occur in?
```{r}
# to get number of presences for each species.
# Note that the first part of the function
# call (veg>0) evaluates to TRUE/FALSE or 1/0),
# and it is the sum of ones and zeros that
# gets calculated.
spc_pres<-apply(data>0,2,sum)

# function (CEDF) for species presences
